# WHAT IS THIS
A quick imperative script that randomizes files in a directory and provides an answer key for what they have changed them to

# WHY DID I MAKE THIS
I thought it was fun and thought it had a practicle purpose in an anonymous guessing game.

# HOW DO I USE THIS
Run the lone python file in terminal using python3, then select the directory you want to randomize (don't worry, your original files will be safe :) )
